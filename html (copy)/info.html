The feeling of overshading loneliness is one that slowly tears away at one's sanity. Finding a will to go on, to keep from becoming naught but a husk. In recent times this has become increasingly taxing on the mind, sometimes hollowing doesn't seem quite so bad in comparison. Sure I would lose all caring, but I would be at peace, dead inside without the burden of the world. For many years I've traveled these lands, watched warriors fall and others flee. And throughout this near endless journey I've found, that no matter what we do, we all crack eventually. And in my sorrow I venture forth yet, in spite of those I've lost so dear to me. To prove...something. Not even sure why I keep this charade up, not like I have anything to live for, I've lost to much and I keep losing. Maybe...just maybe it's just better not to play.
